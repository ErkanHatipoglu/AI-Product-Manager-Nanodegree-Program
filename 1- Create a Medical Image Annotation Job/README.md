## Overview  <a name="overview"/>

In this project, I will design my own data labeling job using [Appen's](https://appen.com/) platform for a given dataset and business goal. 

My goal is to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images.

This can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product that

- Can help flag serious cases
- Quickly identify healthy cases
- And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors

The main task will be to create a data labeling job using [Appen's](https://appen.com/) platform.

## The Data  <a name="data"/>
The dataset is a modified version of this [Kaggle chest x-ray dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), with most labels removed. Every piece of data is a chest x-ray image. You may see images taken that are slightly different in size and taken under slightly different exposure times. A typical, labeled image is shown below:

<p style="color:blue;font-size:10px;">A labeled, healthy, chest x-ray image. Pay close attention to the two lungs and diaphragm (below the lungs).</p>
