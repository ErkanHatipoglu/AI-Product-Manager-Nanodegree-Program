## Overview  <a name="overview"/>

In the [previous project](https://github.com/ErkanHatipoglu/AI-Product-Manager-Nanodegree-Program/tree/main/1-%20Create%20a%20Medical%20Image%20Annotation%20Job), I have created the instructions needed to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images. 

This dataset would eventually be used to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. The goals of this product are to:

- Help flag serious cases,
- Quickly identify healthy cases,
- Generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors.

In this project, I am going to take the next step and build the classification model that would serve as the backbone of this product. For this task, I will use Google AutoML. In order to appreciate how training data impact models, I will build models with 4 variants of the dataset.
