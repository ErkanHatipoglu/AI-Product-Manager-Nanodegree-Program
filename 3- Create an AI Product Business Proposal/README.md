## Overview  <a name="overview"/>

In this final project (Capstone) of the NanoDegree, we will develop a business proposal for an AI product of our own choosing.

We have selected a project about COVID-19 pneumonia detection since we have already made some projects about pneumonia detection in the previous assignments and we can use the gained experience in the final project.

In our business proposal we will cover some important aspects of product development which will be described below.
